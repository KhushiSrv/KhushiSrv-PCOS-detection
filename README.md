Diagnosis of PCOS involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and various tests, such as blood tests and ultrasound imaging. 

Treatment options aim to manage the symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. 

The frequency of the people suffering from this issue is quite large. 

Being the origin of various other complicated issues causing PCOS develops certain serious health problems like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, problems with the heart and blood vessels, and uterine cancer. Women with PCOS often have problems with their ability to get pregnant (fertility). 

Though it is common among women but there are still a majority of people who are unaware of its seriousness.

Therefore, it is necessary to raise awareness among the people. Our project aims on raising awareness about PCOS and then working on the assessment of the severity of the issue among each individual.
